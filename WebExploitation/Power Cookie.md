## **Solution: Step‑by‑Step**

1. From the challenge hint, it is clear that this challenge involves **modifying browser cookies**.
2. Cookies are stored in the browser and can be accessed using **Developer Tools**.
3. Open the website and press **F12** or right‑click → **Inspect** to open Developer Tools.
4. Go to the **Application** tab in Developer Tools.
5. On the left side, navigate to:
    **Storage → Cookies → [Challenge Website]**
6. Here, we find a cookie named **`isAdmin`** with an initial value of **`0`**, which means false or guest access.
7. To gain admin privileges, we change the value from **`0` to `1`**.
8. After modifying the value, **reload the webpage**.
9. The page now recognizes us as an admin and **reveals the flag**.
